</p>

If H1 signal of amplitude of A2=1e-21, is caused by Burkina Faso lightning strike<b>[Ref 2]</b>,
magnetometers cannot distinguish such a low amplitude  of A2=1e-21,</p>in the presence of
<b>ever-present</b> undesired 60*n hz EM Interference, whose  maximum amplitude  A1=0.73e-21, </p>
given flat coupling[flat frequency response] in 20-300Hz range[ See <b>[Ref 3]</b> below]. </p>
.
</p>

1. During quiet times, when no H1 signal is present, Magnetometers will measure ever-present
60*n hz EM signals and show a value B1 which is proportional to A1,</p>  <b>B1=A1*K</b>, where K is a constant.</p>
.
</p>
2. When H1 signal arrives, if H1 signal of amplitude of A2=1e-21, is caused by an external EM signal
like Burkina Faso lightning strike,</p> Magnetometers will measure  EM signal H1 in time domain
and show a value B2 which is proportional to A2,  <b>B2=A2*K</b>, and <b>B2</b> is <b>comparable</b> to B1.</p>
.
</p>
3. This shows Magnetometer reading "3 orders of magnitude too small" argument 
to rule out Burkina Faso lightning strike</p> in LIGO noise characterization paper Page 24, Sec 6.1
is not substantiated by H1/L1 data.[<b>Ref 2</b>] </p>
.
</p>

4.An external EM signal, like <b>lightning</b>, of the same amplitude as H1 signal, will have a 
comparable amplitude/power to 60*n Hz EM signals and </p>
will be <b>hard to distinguish</b> from a GW signal and magnetometers will miss it. This point is elaborated in <b>[Ref 2]</b> below.

<b>[Ref 2]</b>. LIGO <b>noise characterization</b> paper:
There was a strong <b>500kA lightning</b> in Burkina Faso,  It happened around the 
same time as GW signal and could produce coincident EM signal at both sites.
(Hanford and Livingston) Lightning has  <A href="https://theinspireproject.org/default.asp?contentID=4" target="_blank">low frequency </I></A>   components as well in the 
50-300Hz region of interest and this could have been picked up.
<b>Page 24, Sec 6.1</b> of this LIGO document talks about lightning at Burkina Faso:

</p>

The statement in above paper in Page 24 says "Fluxgate magnetometers indicate that magnetic disturbances at the LIGO detectors produced
by coincident lightning strikes were at least <b>3 orders of magnitude too small</b>  to account
for the amplitude of GW150914." This is based on the 50 times drop in magnetic coupling from 60Hz to 180Hz observed during calibration
<A href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~araman/files/H1_L1_demo/LIGO_noise_characterization_page_13.pdf" target="_blank">Click here for plot</I></A> .
This calibration <b>is not applicable</b> for external EM signals like 60*n Hz power line signals and lightning signals, which have <A href="https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/P1500238/fig1.png" target="_blank"> flat coupling</I></A> 
 from 60 Hz to 180 Hz, as explained in <b>[Ref 3] (b)</b>.</p>
An external EM signal like lightning also can strike a power line and
travel through  <A href="http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/lightning/lightning_faq.html#9" target="_blank">electrical wiring </I></A>   inside a building. 
Such a signal also will have flat coupling from 60Hz-180Hz and perhaps beyond and arrive at the analog board with ADC. 

</p>

 60*n Hz EM  interference is more likely picked up by the magnets in
mirror suspension.  Which means  60*n Hz EM signals travel by air/vacuum from power lines
or power outlets to the magnets where they are picked up and have a flat coupling from 60Hz-180Hz.</p>

This means, external EM signals like lightning also can be picked up by the magnets in mirror suspension
and have flat coupling. If these external EM signals have an amplitude/power comparable to
60*n Hz EM tones, magnetometers will miss it. </p>

H1 signal has amplitude/power comparable to the amplitude of 60*n Hz EM tones during null event periods
and cannot be distinguished from an EM signal like lightning.
 This point is demonstrated with Python script <b>H1_L1_demo_1.py</b>:

<b>[Ref 3]</b> <b>(a)</b> <b>Magnetic Coupling calibration</b> experiment has a <b>50 times drop</b> from 60Hz to 180Hz, bottom plot in Figure 2 Page 13 of LIGO Paper 2 at the end.
</p>
 Magnetic coupling at 60 Hz= 1e-10  ;  coupling at 180 Hz  =  2e-12

</p>

<b>(b)</b> While,  60*n hz EM signals from power lines do not have this loss, resulting in <b>flat</b> coupling [flat frequency response].</p>
If we look at the amplitudes of  60*n Hz harmonics in L1 signal, </p>
60 Hz amplitude =  6e-22  ;                  180 Hz amplitude = 3e-22 . 
<A href="https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/P1500238/fig1.png" target="_blank">Click here for plot</I></A> 

</p>

If there were 50 times drop, 180 Hz harmonic amplitude of 3e-22 would correspond to 
a source amplitude of 3e-22*50, </p>
which is 25 times larger than 60Hz fundamental [3e-22*50/6e-22=25], which <b>cannot</b> be the case.
</p>
.
</p>

<b>(c)</b>
Which means, an <b>external EM signal</b> like lightning signal would have same 
<b>flat</b> frequency response from 60Hz-180Hz and perhaps beyond.
